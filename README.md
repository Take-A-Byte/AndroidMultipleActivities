If I start a activity from Main Activity that should be launched in the same app window, I get following error:
> **System.InvalidOperationException:** 'This window is already associated with an active Activity (AndroidMultipleActivities.Droid.MainActivity). Please override CreateWindow on AndroidMultipleActivities.App to add support for multiple activities https://aka.ms/maui-docs-create-window or set the LaunchMode to SingleTop on AndroidMultipleActivities.Droid.OtherActivity.'
